# IronPython-WinForm-Testing
my winform testing in IronPython

//i use VS2010 and VS2015 to develop my IronPython projets, it's unfortunatlly that Visual Designer is not available in the IDE!!!

// it means that we have to do the coding for win form all by ourselves.

//What a pity, i am not a experienced .net developer, i haven't use C# or any .net related code before.
